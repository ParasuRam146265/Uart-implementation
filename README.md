# Uart-implementation
here i implemented uart protocol(transmitter and receiver) using fsm in verilog.tested them with test benches(transtb.v and rectb.v ).
braudrate can be variable for that reason we written code for braudrate generation(braudgenerator.v).It is tested with testbench(braudtb.v).
simulation results are posted as screenshots(for both transmitter and receiver)
